# YOUR NAME HERE

# YOUR CANVAS NAME HERE
# YOUR GITHUB USER NAME HERE

# Due date: Sunday May 5th before midnight
# Write your answers in the space between the questions, and commit/push only
# this file to your repo. Note that there can be a difference between giving a
# "minimally" right answer, and a really good answer, so it can pay to put
# thought into your work.

##################

#NOTE: All of the plots the questions ask for should be saved and committed to
# your repo under the name "q1_1_plot.png" (for 1.1), "q1_2_plot.png" (for 1.2),
# etc. using fig.savefig. If a question calls for more than one plot, name them
# "q1_1a_plot.png", "q1_1b_plot.png",  etc.

# Question 1.1: With the x and y values below, create a plot using only Matplotlib.
# You should plot y1 as a scatter plot and y2 as a line, using different colors
# and a legend.  You can name the data simply "y1" and "y2".  Make sure the
# axis tick labels are legible.  Add a title that reads "HW3 Q1.1".

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import os

x = pd.date_range(start='1990/1/1', end='1991/12/1', freq='MS')
y1 = np.random.normal(10, 2, len(x))
y2 = [np.sin(v)+10 for v in range(len(x))]

# Question 1.2: Using only Matplotlib, reproduce the figure in this repo named
# question_2_figure.png.

# Question 1.3: Load the mpg.csv file that is in this repo, and create a
# plot that tests the following hypothesis: a car with an engine that has
# a higher displacement (i.e. is bigger) will get worse gas mileage than
# one that has a smaller displacement.  Test the same hypothesis for mpg
# against horsepower and weight.

# Question 1.4: Continuing with the data from question 1.3, create a scatter plot 
# with mpg on the y-axis and cylinders on the x-axis.  Explain what is wrong 
# with this plot with a 1-2 line comment.  Now create a box plot using Seaborn
# that uses cylinders as the groupings on the x-axis, and mpg as the values
# up the y-axis.

# Question 1.5: Continuing with the data from question 1.3, create a two-by-two 
# grid of subplots, where each one has mpg on the y-axis and one of 
# displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration on the x-axis.  To clean 
# up this plot:
#   - Remove the y-axis tick labels (the values) on the right two subplots - 
#     the scale of the ticks will already be aligned because the mpg values 
#     are the same in all axis.  
#   - Add a title to the figure (not the subplots) that reads "Changes in MPG"
#   - Add a y-label to the figure (not the subplots) that says "mpg"
#   - Add an x-label to each subplot for the x values
# Finally, use the savefig method to save this figure to your repo.  If any
# labels or values overlap other chart elements, go back and adjust spacing.

# Question 1.6: Are cars from the USA, Japan, or Europe the least fuel
# efficient, on average?  Answer this with a plot and a one-line comment.

# Question 1.7: Using Seaborn, create a scatter plot of mpg versus displacement,
# while showing dots as different colors depending on the country of origin.
# Explain in a one-line comment what this plot says about the results of 
# question 1.6.

# Question 2: The file unemp.csv contains the monthly seasonally-adjusted unemployment
# rates for US states from January 2020 to December 2022. Load it as a dataframe, as well
# as the data from the policy_uncertainty.xlsx file from homework 2 (you do not have to make
# any of the changes to this data that were part of HW2, unless you need to in order to 
# answer the following questions).
#    2.1: Merge both dataframes together
#    2.2: Calculate the log-first-difference (LFD) of the EPU-C data
#    2.2: Select five states and create one Matplotlib figure that shows the unemployment rate
#         and the LFD of EPU-C over time for each state. Save the figure and commit it with 
#         your code.
#    2.3: Using statsmodels, regress the unemployment rate on the LFD of EPU-C and fixed
#         effects for states. Include an intercept.
#    2.4: Print the summary of the results, and write a 1-3 line comment explaining the basic
#         interpretation of the results (e.g. coefficient, p-value, r-squared), the way you 
#         might in an abstract.
